    <h2>Major Goals and Objectives of the Overall Center</h2>
  <br /><br />
<img src="files/enact.png" alt="ENACT program goals">
 <ol>
    <li>A major goal of our Center is to pursue a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to endometriosis through 
     transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis disease
     mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel 
     and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators at 
     UCSF and Stanford University, many of whom are new to endometriosis research and who have expertise in cell and molecular biology, genomics, 
     transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, toxicology, computational science, systems biology, inflammation, immunology, gynecology, reproductive
     endocrinology and pain medicine. Our long-standing Human Endometrial Tissue and DNA Bank and RedCap database along with ongoing accruals with our 
     collaborating surgeons at UCSF, Stanford, Palo Alto, and Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, will be the major resource for this Center.
    </li>
    <li>As the pipeline of researchers in endometriosis is limited, expanding and nurturing this cohort is critical for innovation and 
     sustainability of endometriosis research for improved patient care in the long-term. Thus, another major goal of our P01 Center is to train, 
     inspire and mentor, now and in the future, the next generation of basic, translational and clinical investigators in endometriosis research. 
     A multidisciplinary environment, as proposed herein, is key for new investigators and mentees as they learn more about endometriosis and conduct
     research focused on this enigmatic disease that intersects with multiple disciplines.
    </li>
    <li>Our 3rd major goal is to strengthen the partnership between endometriosis research and affected women, together raising awareness and giving 
     voice to and validating the challenges that women and teens experience who have this chronic disorder. We believe that those who have endometriosis
     are key to progress in research on endometriosis, as they provide the patient perspective. We aspire to be a national resource for endometriosis 
     research for women, investigators, and health care professionals.

  <blockquote>The overall goals of our Center are to understand endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology, develop accurate disease classifications,
   identify novel therapies, improve patient outcomes, train the next generation in endometriosis research, and engage our community in these efforts to
   enrich research and to empower those affected. </blockquote>
