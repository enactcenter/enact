        <p class="darkandgoldline">Participation & Eligibility</p>
	<p>We invite you to consider participating in our study about gynecological and reproductive health,
	being conducted by Drs. Linda Giudice and Marina Sirota at UCSF and Dr. Brice Gaudilliere at Stanford.
	The study’s aim is to advance understanding about the uterine lining (endometrium) and health. <!--We are requesting a portion of the uterine lining during your gynecologic surgery or
	treatment.--> The study is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

	<p>You may be eligible if you:
	<ol>
		<li>Are between the age of 18-40 with regular periods</li>
		<li>Are not currently using any form of hormonal contraceptive (birth control pill, patch, IUD, implant, ring, etc.), GnRH analog (e.g., Buserelin, Goserelin, Leuprorelin, Naferelin, or Triptorelin), or aromatase inhibitor (e.g., letrozole and anastrozole)</li>
		<li>Are HIV negative</li>
		<li>Are generally healthy with no significant medical conditions (e.g., cancer)</li>
		<!--<li>Have NO history of endometriosis, pelvic pain, or other gynecological disorders</li>-->
		<li>Not currently pregnant</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>If you are interested in learning more about the study, please contact our study coordinator directly 
	(UCSF: <a href="mailto:endo-research@listsrv.ucsf.edu">endo-research@listsrv.ucsf.edu</a>. Stanford: <a href="mailto:gynresearch@stanford.edu">gynresearch@stanford.edu</a>)
	before your gynecologic surgery/appointment and indicate
	your availability for a zoom or phone call with our study coordinator to review the study in more detail.<p>

	<p>Participating in this study is entirely voluntary. It will not affect your medical care if you decide not to reply
	or decide not to participate in the study.</p>
	<p>We hope that you will consider participating in our study as we strive to further understand the biological
	impacts of the endometrium in health.<br /><br /></p>

	<p class="darkandgoldline">FAQs</p>

	<p class="dark">What are my rights if I take part in this study?</p>
	<p>Taking part in this study is your choice. You may choose either to take part or not to take part in
	the study. If you decide to take part in this study, you may leave the study at any time. No
	matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you and you will not lose any of your
	regular benefits. Leaving the study will not affect your medical care. You can still get your
	medical care from our institution.</p>
	
	<p class="dark">How will I know that my confidentiality will be protected?</p>
	<p>This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.
	This means that the researchers cannot release or use information, documents, or samples that
	may identify you in any action or suit unless you say it is okay. They also cannot provide them as
	evidence unless you have agreed. This protection includes federal, state, or local civil, criminal,
	administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. An example would be a court subpoena. The Certificate does not stop
	reporting that federal, state or local laws require. Some examples are laws that require reporting
	of child or elder abuse, some communicable diseases, and threats to harm yourself or others.
	The Certificate cannot be used to stop a sponsoring United States federal or state
	government agency from checking records or evaluating programs. The Certificate does not
	stop disclosures required by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Certificate
	also does not prevent your information from being used for other research if allowed by
	federal regulations.</p>

	<p></p>


	<p class="dark">Can I stop being in the study?</p>
	<p>Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor or co-investigators if you are
	thinking about stopping or decide to stop. If you decide to stop before the procedure, no specimen
	will be obtained and no blood sample will be taken for this study, and no information will be
	collected from your medical records. If, in the future, you decide that you don’t want to have your
	tissue or blood used for research, inform the UCSF investigators in writing and all of your
	specimens and data will be destroyed if they have not been used or unlinked. </p>
