 	<p><span class="dark">Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating estrogen-dependent disease</span> wherein tissue similar to the uterine lining (endometrium) is found mainly on pelvic tissues and organs where it causes an inflammatory response, scarring, pelvic pain, and infertility. It <span class="dark">affects millions</span> of reproductive age women and <span class="dark">severely impacts quality of life</span> and professional life, and has a huge health economic impact of about $69B annually in the U.S. While its etiology is uncertain, profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with inefficient lesion clearance and pelvic and systemic inflammation. </p> 
	<p>The heterogeneity of endometriosis lesions and disease phenotypes is reflected in variable pain symptom presentations, unpredictable fertility potential, uncertain disease pathophysiology, and unpredictable responses to medical therapies, symptom and disease recurrence after surgical resection, and risks for co-morbidities. Clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to the heterogeneity of disease expression, and thus efficient treatments for associated pain symptoms are lacking.</p>
	</p>Herein, our <span class="dark">UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (“ENACT”)</span> proposes a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to endometriosis. We propose to study endometriosis unmet needs and challenges through transdisciplinary collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis disease mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms.</p>
	<p>To achieve these goals, <span class="dark">our Center is comprised of 3 independent and interactive projects and 2 Cores, focused on the central theme of Endometriosis Precision Medicine</span>.
		<ul>
			<li><span class="darkandgoldline">Project 1</span> Leveraging Single-Cell Technologies to Elucidate Niche Environments and Immune Mechanisms Involved in Endometriosis Pathogenesis, Pathophysiology, and Disease Stratification. Project 1 will focus on underlying immunological mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology.</li>
			<li><span class="darkandgoldline">Project 2</span> Mass Spectrometry-based Global Molecular Approaches and Computational Tools to Determine Phenotypic and Environmental Signatures of Endometriosis. Project 2 will address developing a multi-omic disease classification that will inform diagnostic strategies.</li>
			<li><span class="darkandgoldline">Project 3</span> Integrating Omics Based Computational Approaches to Identify and Validate Novel Therapeutic Candidates for Endometriosis. Project 3 will leverage existing and newly generated large-scale omic data to identify and validate new therapeutic interventions.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The <span class="darkandgoldline">Administrative Core</span> will assure achievement of the goals of the Center and financial accountability and research compliance for all Projects and Cores across both institutions.</li>
			<li>The <span class="darkandgoldline">Education and Community Outreach Core</span>'s goals are to train and mentor new investigators in endometriosis research and to empower women with endometriosis to understand their symptoms and options for care and to inform the research community, from the patient’s perspective, about their needs and goals. 			</li>
		</ul>

Our long-standing Human Endometrial Tissue and DNA Bank and REDCap database and ongoing accruals with our collaborating network of surgeons will be a major resource for this Center's project. The Center will have an Administrative Core and an Education and Community Outreach Core that will engage students from the Bay Area in our research programs and empower women in our community and address health disparities associated with endometriosis. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University, many of whom are new to endometriosis research, as well as educators, trainees, and community representatives who are all committed to improve the lives of women and teen girls with endometriosis. Integrating multiple disciplines, fostering collaborations among those who are new to endometriosis, training the next generation and partnering with our community are key to the outcomes and impact of our Endometriosis Center.</p>

	<p><span class="darkandgoldline">PROJECT 1</span> <span class="dark"> Leveraging Single-Cell Technologies to Elucidate Niche Environments and Immune Mechanisms Involved in Endometriosis Pathogenesis, Pathophysiology, and Disease Stratification. Project 1</span> will be co-directed by Linda Giudice, MD, PhD (UCSF), a reproductive endocrinologist and endometriosis researcher, Brice Gaudilliere, MD, PhD (Stanford), an immunologist and anesthesiologist, and Marina Sirota, PhD (UCSF), a computational scientist. <span class="dark">Project 1</span> will leverage single nuclei transcriptomics to determine lesion niche environments and immune mechanisms involved in endometriosis pathogenesis, pathophysiology and disease stratification. 
   		<ul>
			<li>In the <span class="dark">Aim 1</span>, transcriptomic signatures of the three most common endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis will be determined at the single cell resolution and in different hormonal milieu. The interactome among immune and non- immune cells and functional studies of aberrant gene signatures in specific cell types that will inform lesion pathophysiology and phenotyping will be pursued, as well as functional studies on myeloid phagocytic system abnormalities in women with disease.
			</li>
			<li><span class="dark">Aim 2</span> will determine the contribution of the lesion, endometrial, and peripheral immune systems to the pathobiology of endometriosis and integrate these data to identify immunological signatures of dysfunctionality that differentiate endometriosis disease types. 
			<li><span class="dark">Aim 3</span> will integrate the single-cell data of the lesions, surrounding niche tissues, endometrium, and local and peripheral immune systems and apply advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify disease subtypes based on single-cell molecular signatures.
			</li>

   <p><span class="darkandgoldline">ADMINISTRATIVE CORE</span> The Center will be administered by the Administrative Core, co-Directed by two senior investigators – Dr. Linda Giudice at UCSF and Dr. David Stevenson at Stanford University, who have extensive experience in translational and clinical research and administrative leadership of large, complex research programs. Through this administrative structure they will assure achievement of the goals of the Center and financial accountability and research compliance for all Projects and Cores across both institutions. They have collaborated extensively with the Project Leads in this P01.</p>

<p><span class="darkandgoldline">EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH CORE</span> The Education and Community Outreach Core is Directed by Jessica Opoku-Anane, MD (UCSF), a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon focused on endometriosis, with Co-lead, Synthia Mellon, PhD (UCSF), a neuroscientist and Interim Director of the Center for Reproductive Sciences. The goals of the Core are to train and mentor new investigators in endometriosis research and to empower women with endometriosis to understand their symptoms and options for care and to inform the research community, from the patient’s perspective, about their needs and goals. The educational component will assure that the next generation of basic, translational and clinical investigators in endometriosis research are nurtured and mentored. This will be through assuring mentor-mentee meetings, trainees partaking in the research in the Center’s labs, attending research meetings, CRS workshops, the CRS Reproductive Research Day, attending professional meetings to present their work, and networking among peers and other researchers in the field and in relevant and diverse disciplines. Dr. Opoku-Anane interfaces with the medical education community and the patient community, and Dr. Mellon, a basic researcher, interfaces with UCSF training programs for UCSF student and fellows and also for San Francisco high school and community college students. A multidisciplinary environment, as proposed herein, is key for new investigators and mentees as they learn more about endometriosis and conduct research focused on this enigmatic disease that intersects with multiple disciplines.
