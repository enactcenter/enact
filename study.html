	<p><span class="darkandgoldline">PROJECT 1</span> <span class="dark"> Leveraging Single-Cell Technologies to Elucidate Niche Environments and Immune Mechanisms Involved in Endometriosis Pathogenesis, Pathophysiology, and Disease Stratification. Project 1</span> will be co-directed by Linda Giudice, MD, PhD (UCSF), a reproductive endocrinologist and endometriosis researcher, Brice Gaudilliere, MD, PhD (Stanford), an immunologist and anesthesiologist, and Marina Sirota, PhD (UCSF), a computational scientist. <span class="dark">Project 1</span> will leverage single nuclei transcriptomics to determine lesion niche environments and immune mechanisms involved in endometriosis pathogenesis, pathophysiology and disease stratification. 
		<ul>
			<li>In the <span class="dark">Aim 1</span>, transcriptomic signatures of the three most common endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis will be determined at the single cell resolution and in different hormonal milieu. The interactome among immune and non- immune cells and functional studies of aberrant gene signatures in specific cell types that will inform lesion pathophysiology and phenotyping will be pursued, as well as functional studies on myeloid phagocytic system abnormalities in women with disease.
			</li>
			<li><span class="dark">Aim 2</span> will determine the contribution of the lesion, endometrial, and peripheral immune systems to the pathobiology of endometriosis and integrate these data to identify immunological signatures of dysfunctionality that differentiate endometriosis disease types. 
			<li><span class="dark">Aim 3</span> will integrate the single-cell data of the lesions, surrounding niche tissues, endometrium, and local and peripheral immune systems and apply advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify disease subtypes based on single-cell molecular signatures.
			</li>
		</ul>

     <p><span class="darkandgoldline">PROJECT 2</span> <span class="dark">Mass Spectrometry-based Global Molecular Approaches and Computational Tools to Determine Phenotypic and Environmental Signatures of Endometriosis. Project 2</span> is Co-Directed by Susan Fisher, PhD (UCSF), a placental biologist and Director of the UCSF Sandler Moore Mass Spectrometry Core and Tracey Woodruff, PhD (UCSF), a reproductive epidemiologist and environmental scientist. Co-leads are Joshua Robinson, PhD (UCSF), a toxicologist, and Nima Aghaeepour, PhD (Stanford), a machine learning expert. <span class="dark">Project 2</span> will determine proteomic, metabolomic and environmental signatures of endometriosis using mass spectrometry-based global molecular approaches and advanced computational tools. This project will investigate signatures of metabolic analytes and environmental chemicals in women with and without disease. 

   	<ul>
	<li><span class="dark">Aim 1</span> will identify protein biomarkers in endometriosis and endometrial tissues and sera in women with and without endometriosis, using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach.
	</li>
	<li><span class="dark">Aim 2</span> will identify metabolomic and exposomic features in banked sera associated with endometriosis.
	</li>
	<li><span class="dark">Aim 3</span> will utilize machine learning-based approaches to define phenotypic molecular signatures of endometriosis.
	</li>
   	</ul>

     <p> <span class="darkandgoldline">PROJECT 3</span> <span class="dark">Integrating Omics Based Computational Approaches to Identify and Validate Novel Therapeutic Candidates for Endometriosis. Project 3</span> is Co-Directed by Marina Sirota, PhD (UCSF) and Brice Gaudilliere, MD, PhD (Stanford), and Lead Stacy McAllister, PhD (Emory) who is an expert in animal models of endometriosis-related pain. <span class="dark">Project 3</span> will integrate omics-based computational approaches to identify and validate novel therapeutic candidates for endometriosis. Aim 1 will use transcriptomic-based computational drug-repurposing to identify potential new single agent and combination therapeutics based on expression reversal, leveraging publicly available transcriptomic data. Furthermore, single cell transcriptomics profiles identified in <span class="dark">Project 1</span> could be incorporated into this methodology. <span class="dark">Aim 2</span> will determine the capacity of 15 compounds or combination treatments of interest to modulate inflammatory signaling responses in primary human immune and endometrial cells leveraging a high-throughput mass-tag barcoding CyTOF assay. <span class="dark">Aim 3</span> will evaluate in vivo the efficacy of 5 compounds and 3 combination therapies of interest as pain therapeutics in a preclinical endometriosis model.<br />

   <p><span class="darkandgoldline">ADMINISTRATIVE CORE</span> The Center will be administered by the Administrative Core, co-Directed by two senior investigators – Dr. Linda Giudice at UCSF and Dr. David Stevenson at Stanford University, who have extensive experience in translational and clinical research and administrative leadership of large, complex research programs. Through this administrative structure they will assure achievement of the goals of the Center and financial accountability and research compliance for all Projects and Cores across both institutions. They have collaborated extensively with the Project Leads in this P01.</p>

<p><span class="darkandgoldline">EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH CORE</span> The Education and Community Outreach Core is Directed by Jessica Opoku-Anane, MD (UCSF), a minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon focused on endometriosis, with Co-lead, Synthia Mellon, PhD (UCSF), a neuroscientist and Interim Director of the Center for Reproductive Sciences. The goals of the Core are to train and mentor new investigators in endometriosis research and to empower women with endometriosis to understand their symptoms and options for care and to inform the research community, from the patient’s perspective, about their needs and goals. The educational component will assure that the next generation of basic, translational and clinical investigators in endometriosis research are nurtured and mentored. This will be through assuring mentor-mentee meetings, trainees partaking in the research in the Center’s labs, attending research meetings, CRS workshops, the CRS Reproductive Research Day, attending professional meetings to present their work, and networking among peers and other researchers in the field and in relevant and diverse disciplines. Dr. Opoku-Anane interfaces with the medical education community and the patient community, and Dr. Mellon, a basic researcher, interfaces with UCSF training programs for UCSF student and fellows and also for San Francisco high school and community college students. A multidisciplinary environment, as proposed herein, is key for new investigators and mentees as they learn more about endometriosis and conduct research focused on this enigmatic disease that intersects with multiple disciplines.
